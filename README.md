Every week I add new functions to game. After new update, game up to new version. I.e. v001 => v002; v002 => v003 and v003 => v004 and more.

Changes may be every day, but they don't be global.

This line you can see after updating the function ghelp(), but in the game the test version is already built. After writing down your question, press Enter. There will be instructions on what to do next.
