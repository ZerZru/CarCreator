# Welcome to the new documentation for CarCreator!
##This documentation avialable for version v003 and above

CarCreator is a console game written in Python. All you need is to install the game and write just 2 lines of code so that you have already started creating your first car.

## Installation
```git
pip install CarCreator
```
Is not yet available, so you will have to download the files manually. Soon on site http://www.scgofficial.esy.es/CarCreator/ I'll add an archive with the game to make your life easier.

After downloading the files, you need to move(or copy) to the root directory of the Python interpreter. This is usually ./Local/Programs/Python/Python-[version]/

no more lines of code! Almost...:

```python
import carcreator
```

You can also simply run the file by double-clicking the LMB

After running game, just select a version:
![selver](https://github.com/ZerZru/CarCreator/blob/master/Images/selver.jpg)

![ghelp_function](https://github.com/ZerZru/CarCreator/blob/master/Images/ghelp_function.jpg)

And just write function name. Without ()!

## Video

Especially for you, I recorded a video to demonstrate how to use the game. Also, this video can be used if you do not understand the documentation how to play CarCreator

## If you have a problem

My game is broken? Stupid developers do nothing, although you called the support() function, opened the question.txt and sent the text out of it to mail? Perhaps you did something wrong or the letter is not yet reached.

I took care of it in the log file as log.txt indicated only the important information. I think there might be a solution to your problem.

Coming soon tech support add for site.

## Change game version

If you want select another version of game, just change branch. <br>
![select_version](https://github.com/ZerZru/CarCreator/blob/master/Images/select_version.gif) <br>
Profit!

This page will be gradually updated, so periodically visit it. Thanks.
